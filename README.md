# Adversarial Robustness of Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models in Machine Learning

The for the Master's Thesis "Adversarial Robustness of Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models in Machine Learning
". 

![PCBM Revision](https://github.com/MariaBulychev/Thesis_5/blob/master/pcbm_revision__3.png?raw=true "PCBM Revision Image")

This represents an overview on Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Models, as proposed in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15480.pdf). 

We propose a novel method of learning the concepts employing adversarial traning.
